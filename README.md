# NFT_GENERATION_Project

Description/Problem this project solves:

My project offers a stable and efficient platform for the creation of NFTs, providing users with the 
ability to create unique and valuable digital assets without the hassle of manual creation processes. 
Additionally, by utilizing AI technology, my platform minimizes the risk of errors and inconsistencies, 
ensuring that NFTs are minted to the highest quality standards. Furthermore, my project enables users 
to take advantage of the growing popularity and potential of NFTs, providing them with the opportunity 
to monetize their digital creations and tap into the rapidly growing NFT market.

Overall, my project offers a solution that addresses the challenges and limitations of 
manual NFT creation and provides users the ability to tap into a powerful AI tool for creating, managing, 
and monetizing their digital assets.


Why its unique?

The use of stable diffusion AI sets it apart from traditional NFT creation platforms that rely on manual 
processes. By automating the NFT creation process, my platform offers a faster and more efficient 
solution, reducing the risk of errors as well as time spent on image creation. Additionally, the use of 
AI technology provides a unique approach to NFT creation, allowing users to leverage the benefits of AI
to create NFTs with images that they might not of thought of creating prior. 


About my project:

When I first started to build this project, I had originally set out to create a platform where users 
could Mint immutable, soul-bound, Academic Degree NFTs by pasting the Degree field, school, year, and 
the IPFS hash of their preferred degree image into my UI. 
Here is a screenshot of what my original UI looked like (attached):

However, after creating that, I discovered a video on Youtube via Dapp University, where Greg integrates 
Ai into an NFT platform. It then became very clear to me, that leveraging Ai would be a much easier and 
more general solution for users to Mint NFTs, rather than having them go through using IPFS and 
pasting the hash. Hereâ€™s the link to the Dapp university Video and code:

Code: https://github.com/dappuniversity/ai_nft_generator

and so, I have now created a new version of this project, which is the code in this repository.

Thanks for reading and checking it out!
